# What’s the Difference Between Data Analytics and Data Analysis?

Data analysis and data analytics are often treated as interchangeable terms, but they hold slightly different meanings.

Essentially, the primary difference between analytics and analysis is a matter of scale, as data analytics is a broader term of which data analysis is a subcomponent. Data analysis refers to the process of examining, transforming and arranging a given data set in specific ways in order to study its individual parts and extract useful information. Data analytics is an overarching science or discipline that encompasses the complete management of data. This not only includes analysis, but also data collection, organisation, storage, and all the tools and techniques used.

It’s the role of the data analyst to collect, analyse, and translate data into information that’s accessible. By identifying trends and patterns, analysts help organisations make better business decisions. Their ability to describe, predict, and improve performance has placed them in increasingly high demand globally and across industries.
